* matriu
this is the code for the =matriu= midi controller

it runs on an [[https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neotrellis-m4/overview][Arduino NeoTrellis M4]]. it's currently a work in progress

** setup
install =cargo-hf2= if you haven't already:
#+begin_src bash
$ cargo install cargo-hf2
#+end_src

then connect the device in bootloader mode (by hitting the reset button twice), then run:

#+begin_src bash
$ cargo hf2 --release
#+end_src

and it should be ready!
** design
this is work in progress ^^
*** normal mode
first column is for config

holding the first key switches to key select mode
holding the second key switches to scale select mode
the other two keys are for switching to other (not currently designed) config modes

the rest of the columns are for playing the notes of the scale
each row is an octave
*** key select mode
in key select mode, columns 5-7 are used to select a note, from C to B
columns 1-4 are used to display the selected note
*** scale select mode
shows buttons to select major, minor, dorian, phrigian, etc
in order
*** config mode
smth to select the center octave
*** a mode to play chords?
