* matriu
this is the code for the =matriu= midi controller

it runs on an [[https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neotrellis-m4/overview][Arduino NeoTrellis M4]]. it's currently a work in progress

** setup
install =cargo-hf2= if you haven't already:
#+begin_src bash
$ cargo install cargo-hf2
#+end_src

then connect the device in bootloader mode (by hitting the reset button twice), then run:

#+begin_src bash
$ cargo hf2 --release
#+end_src

and it should be ready!
** design
this is work in progress ^^
