* matriu
this is the code for the =matriu= midi controller

it runs on an [[https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neotrellis-m4/overview][Arduino NeoTrellis M4]]. it's currently a work in progress

** setup
install =cargo-hf2= if you haven't already:
#+begin_src bash
$ cargo install cargo-hf2
#+end_src

then connect the device in bootloader mode (by hitting the reset button twice), then run:

#+begin_src bash
$ cargo hf2 --release
#+end_src

and it should be ready!
** design
this is work in progress ^^
*** normal mode
first column is for config

holding the first key switches to root select mode
holding the second key switches to config mode
pressing the third key cycles through submodes
pressing the fourth key toggles sustain

there's three submodes
**** notes
columns 2-8 play the different notes of the currently selected scale
each row is one octave
**** chords
columns 2-8 play chords from the scale, from the first degree to the seventh
the first row plays them normally
second row plays the first inversion
third row plays the second inversion
**** chords extra
plays 7ths, add9, 11ths, etc
*** select root mode
in key select mode, columns 5-7 are used to select a note, from C to B
sharp notes are highlighted with a different color

columns 1-4 are used to display the selected note, using a small 4x4 font
sharps are marked with a red dot on the right side

pressing the second button on the first column will lock key select on, so you can stop holding the top left button
when in lock mode, pressing either the first or second buttons will go back to normal mode
*** config mode
the first row selects the scale, in order: Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian

buttons 7 and 8 on second row are =-5= and =+5= to velocity
buttons 7 and 8 on third row are =-1= and =+1= to octave
buttons 7 and 8 on fourth row are =-1= and =+1= to brightness

button 1 on the first row will send note off for all notes. you can use this if there's any hanging notes
